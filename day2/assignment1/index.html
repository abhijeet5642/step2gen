        <p>Stanford’s James March might have some insight. His book On Leadership (see our earlier notes here) is a
            collection of insights derived mostly from the study of great literature, from Don Quixote to Saint Joan to
            War & Peace. In March’s estimation, we can learn more about human nature (of which leadership is merely a
            subset) from studying literature than we can from studying leadership literature.</p>
